-- main
-- Origin. The starting point of your project.
-- This is the only file Corona SDK will require to work. If it doesn't exist, you'll see an error.


local composer = require ("composer")		-- Include the Composer library
-- You can refer to this document for more information about Composer -> http://docs.coronalabs.com/api/library/composer/index.html

-- You can make Composer store your variables by this method.
-- Consider these, global variables that Composer stores for you.
-- Later in the project, you can call use/change this variables.
-- It doesn't matter if it's a string or a number in Lua. I just named them like this for easier understanding.
composer.setVariable("Dropbox_Key", "")
--
composer.setVariable("fontSize", 64)

-- Go to the "logo" scene that's inside "screens" folder in 1000 ms with the "crossFade" effect
-- Refer to the Composer API for more transition options.
--composer.gotoScene("screens.logo", "crossFade", 1000)
local checkKey = composer.getVariable("Dropbox_Key")
local warningTxt = display.newText( "Dropbox Secret Missing", display.contentCenterX, display.contentCenterY, display.contentWidth, display.contentHeight, native.systemFont, 60 )
warningTxt:setFillColor( 0, 0.5, 1 )

if (checkKey ~= "") then
	warningTxt:removeSelf()
	warningTxt = nil
	composer.gotoScene("screens.mainMenu", "crossFade", 1000)
end
